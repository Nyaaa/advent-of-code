To simplify things, I decided to make a State class to store all that. This allows us to make a custom lt method for determining priority (we want the states with the least mana spent)."

This is probably not a very good implementation, I'd prefer this class to be immutable, but then we'd need to come up with a different way to keep track of spell timers."
