    "This puzzle is essentially a travelling salesman problem, except we don't return to the starting point. NetworkX library has `networkx.algorithms.approximation.traveling_salesman_problem` that sounds just right, but for some reason I couldn't get it to give me the shortest route, even though it should understand weights, so I ended up just bruteforcing it. The search space is only 40k permutations, so it's fine. We don't really need networkx here, but I was too lazy to refactor. "
